# Bitcoin Price Forecasting Project — README DS340W

Welcome! This repository holds the final version of our Bitcoin Price Forecasting and Anomaly Detection project that we have developed for this course. You’ll notice a handful of exploratory scripts and notebooks from the parent papers early development stages, but all of the polished and complete work can be found in our main notebook below, which represents the final direction of our project:

## Project Overview
Our main goal for this project was to explore how different data-driven techniques can be used to forecast Bitcoin price movements and detect anomalies in the time series and just have a more overall anomaly-aware approach. 
Our final implementation includes:

- Data preparation and normalization
- Baseline modeling with two forecasting methods
- Error evaluation and model comparison
- Visual analysis of predicted vs. actual values
- Discussion of model limitations and improvements

---

## Extra Notes:
- All dependencies (such as yfinance) are installed directly inside the notebook using standard !pip install commands.

- Thanks so much for taking the time to review our project we really appreciate it!
